v2.4.1 - Hotfix for a rare Segmentation Fault crash in Gigahorse plot backend
========================================================================
- Fixed an abrupt crash occurring sometimes following a "Segmentation Fault (Core Dumped)"
  message when farming with the Gigahorse plot backend.

v2.4.0 - A large maintenance release containing a lot of fixes and improvements
========================================================================
- Added support for the Chinese region (cn). You may now specify `cn` in your config
  if you want to use it.
- Fixed large memory/OS thread footprint when farming with Gigahorse plot backend.
- Removed stealth networking features originally introduced in v2.0.2 and replaced
  them with a more lightweight solution to avoid common blockage, which includes
  the Chinese Great Firewall (GFW).
- FlexFarmer will now warn you if an unknown configuration directive is found.
- Fixed a regression that made it impossible to farm with a local self-hosted node with
  FlexFarmer version v2.3.0 and higher until this release.

v2.3.2 - Maintenance release containing small fixes and improvements
========================================================================
- Fixed DNS-over-HTTPS not working properly behind the Chinese Great Firewall.
- FlexFarmer will now tell you that Gigahorse plot backend is available on Linux only if
  you try running it on unsupported OS/Arch.
- Fixed error handling for Gigahorse plot backend. Previously, it was showing random bytes
  as an error message.
- FlexFarmer will now show the plotting address to be used on startup. This is useful if
  you don't have a synced node to view it in the PlotNFT dashboard.

v2.3.1 - Maintenance release with several minor fixes and improvements
========================================================================
- Hardened against another round of Chinese Great Firewall blockage. FlexFarmer will now work perfectly
  fine under harsh network censoring.
- Better error message indicating that the OS/Arch does not support Gigahorse plots.

v2.3.0 - Support for Gigahorse Compressed Plots (up to +47.2% income boost)
========================================================================
- Added support for Gigahorse plots. With Gigahorse plots, a fee of 3% for GPU and 1.5% for CPU is charged.
- Minor fixes and enhancements.

v2.2.0 Release - Major upgrade with new features
========================================================================

- Direct I/O integration, enabled by default (not supported on Solaris and OpenBSD).
- Ability to farm using a self-hosted node, configured with `self_hosted_node_url` configuration directive.
- Added sequential plot load mode with optional per-drive delay. Please see example configuration for more info.
- Updated end user license agreement (covers all previous versions too).
- Fixed stealth networking features not working properly or triggering certain firewall systems.
- Fixed issues running large farms on macOS.
- Upgraded fsnotify for improved plot hot reload performance.
- Minor bug fixes.

v2.1.0 Release - Maintenance update with a couple features
========================================================================
- Added unified US region. Config values `us-east` and `us-west` are now aliased to `us`.
- All HDD-related Prometheus metrics are now exported with `dir` label, allowing you to closely monitor single drives separately.
- Fixed filesystem watcher errors on Windows.
- Tidied logging, added comments to common error logs hinting the issue.
- Upgraded Go version to 1.19.

v2.0.3 Release - Log file level and fixes
========================================================================
- Implemented ability to select the log level for the log file. This is done by using the `log_file_level`
configuration directive. The default is set to `info`.
- Fixed hot plot removal not working.

v2.0.2 Release - Stealth Networking Features & Improvements
========================================================================
- Implemented Stealth Networking features as a solution to recent blockage made by Chinese ISPs. These
  features include DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and no-SNI TLS. They are enabled by default, but you always can
  disable them by specifying `disable_stealth_networking: true` in your config.yml file.
- Introduced a concurrency limiter in FlexFarmer initial plot load. Prior to this release, FlexFarmer
  could fail because of creating too many threads and/or opening more files than ulimit allows.
  The default concurrency limit is 1024 threads, that can be configured by `max_async_plot_load_threads`.
- If hot plot load has failed because of EOF error (occurs during copying the plot), FlexFarmer will
  try to load it again in 30 seconds. No need to rename the plot to .tmp in order to copy plots now.
- Notifications! Currently only Discord webhooks are supported, with plans to extend the coverage in
  the future (suggestions are welcome).
- Now FlexFarmer will not skip the first signage point.
- Since people don't check the Get Started downloads page often, FlexFarmer will now check if a newer
  version is available on startup, and notify you if so.
- Other minor fixes & improvements.

v2.0.1 Release - Addressing 2.0 issues
========================================================================
- Windows instability was fixed.
- Reported space is no longer raising without a reason.
- k33 and higher size plots are now working.
- Added block win easter egg.

v2.0.0 Release - Major upgrade under the hood
========================================================================
In this release, we have moved from the Chiapos C++ implementation provided by Chia developers
to our very own optimized Chiapos implementation written in Go. Reference C++ implementation
was giving a lot of problems to us. With the move towards our own Chiapos Go implementation,
we are happy to provide a list of improvements:
- Lookup times are minimized by up to 2x depending on your hardware configuration. RPi and other
  embedded users will see the most significant improvement since improvements we've made target
  low to mid range hardware. If you were using Xeon/EPYC servers for farming, you will see only
  a minor performance boost.
- No more "unknown pc" crashes and segmentation faults caused by the reference C++ Chiapos
  implementation.
- FlexFarmer executable is now statically-linked, which means that you won't need a specific
  version of glibc and other libraries. All now is bundled to the FlexFarmer binary. (You can
  run FlexFarmer under ancient CentOS 7 now).
  - FlexFarmer now supports all OSes and architectures supported by Golang. OSes supported
  include Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenbSD, NetBSD, and even Solaris! We also support
  a numerous amount of architectures, including native 32-bit systems (no need to use qemu to
  emulate 64-bit OS on RPi Zero from now). To extend FlexFarmer ecosystem, we also provide binaries
  for embedded architectures like MIPS (all derivatives), and RISC-V (64 bit), and some other exotic
  architectures like ppc (PowerPC) and s390x (System/360), just because we can :D.
- Additionally, FlexFarmer is no longer crashing when a plot that has been in use by FlexFarmer was deleted.

v1.1.0 Release
========================================================================
- Advanced healthcheck-based failover that delegates to https://<REGION_ENDPOINT>/healthy. 
  This failover covers 100% of possible infrastructure-wide incidents (includes issues with the Chia node).
- Only a single plot is being added/removed if there is a change in the plot set.
- Instant plot hot-reload via fsnotify. (`plot_recheck_interval` directive in the config is no longer effective).
- Fixed Windows AntiVirus software flagging FlexFarmer as malicious:
    - UPX binary compression was removed
    - Debug info is now included to the FlexFarmer binary.
- Fail if no plots are available.
- Fixed possible panics during concurrent block submission.

v1.0.1 Release
========================================================================
- Fixed farmer public key serialization data race that caused occasional false wrong plot farmer public key errors.
- Fixed wrong farmer secret key extraction that affected ~1.2% of mnemonics.
- Do not compute plot directories hash of unaccessible directories (lost+found, System Volume Information, $RECYCLE.BIN, etc.)

v1.0.0 Release
